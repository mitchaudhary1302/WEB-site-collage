            <p class="har4">As an institute, we see ourselves as the loopback address in the network of your lives. Just as the loopback address returns traffic to its source, we are always here, at the heart of your journey, ready to connect, support, and nurture you—no matter where life takes you.</p>

                <p class="har4">Though you have ventured far and wide, acquiring your own IP Addresses, making your mark in various domains, the college remains a central, unwavering part of your story. You may move forward, but we are always here for you, just as the loopback address is always present, quietly facilitating connections.</p>
                
                <p class="har4">In this ever-evolving world, we invite you to continue returning to us. As alumni, you are an integral part of the foundation we've built together. The knowledge, values, and networks forged within these walls are the ties that bind us, and we hope you will loop back to share your experiences, mentor the next generation, and continue to grow alongside us.</p>
                
                <p class="har4">No matter the distance, you will always have a home here. The college is your loopback address, and we are eager to see how you will continue to contribute to the legacy we've all created. We would be glad to "host" you as always!</p>
